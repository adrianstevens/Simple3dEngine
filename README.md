# Simple3dEngine
A very basic software 3D engine written in C#.

This project has two purposes:
1. So I can learn the basics of 3D rendering
2. To see if it's possible to run 3D animations on the Wilderness Labs' Meadow IoT platform - specifically the Project Lab and Juego IoT accelerators

Input, feedback and pull requests are always welcome!
